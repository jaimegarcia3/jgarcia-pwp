<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to act as a professional portfolio and will provide information about my web-development career. </p>

<h1>Audience</h1>
<p>This site is designed for a potential employers and clients or anyone who is wanting to view my skills and accomplishments. </p>

<h1>Goal</h1>
<p>This site is to create a place where I can showcase my skills and accomplishments to potential employers or clients with the end goal of landing a career or clientele.</p>

<h1>Persona</h1>
    <h2>Greg Humphry</h2>


    <h2>Profession</h2>
<p>The owner of a local clothing company, Run Wear, has been seeing a rapid growth in popularity across various social media platforms.
    Greg has taken steps to enhance the manufacturing process, but he is having trouble showcasing his new styles across all his social media channels,
    keeping customers informed about restocks, and providing a centralized platform for purchasing his products. He is looking for a developer to create a
    website where he can have all this information, including updates on restocks, links to his social media accounts, and a contact form for customer inquiries.
    He also wants to offer customers the option to sign up for a newsletter to stay updated on Run Wear's latest offerings and developments.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
<p>He is an apple user and uses a MacBook M3 Pro with a 16-inch display and a iPhone 15 Pro during both his work and personal time.</p>

    <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
<p>Passionate about his work and very particular about where he spends his time. Greg needs something to catch his attention but when it does he is very meticulous.
Very big on social media presence so when seeking potential employees he scours the internet to see how they might represent his company outside of work. Although
Greg looks for someone who is capable and professional enough to work for him and his company, he also looks for personality and someone who is able to work
efficiently with others and is pleasant to be around. </p>

    <h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
<p>Greg needs someone who is skilled and knows what they are doing. He is not too concerned about a degree but needs some sort of evidence that the person he hires
has said skills whether that is past employment history or great examples of past projects with a history of them constantly practicing and sharpening their abilities.
Greg is being very meticulous because he is willing to pay generously and would like to be provided with what is necessary to make him feel comfortable with his
decision.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Greg's goal is to hire someone with the skills to develop his website, the personality to be around them for hours at a time and the professionalism to represent
his company in a good light. He wants something that will catch his attention but when he applies a magnifying glass there will be little to no flaws.
He also would like to be able to contact who he is interested in with ease. </p>

<h1>User Story</h1>
<p>As a user, I need a site that will catch my eye while simultaneously giving me the information I need to determine if this person is suitable to hire. </p>
